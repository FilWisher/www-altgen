        <br>
          <p>
          Altgen is a young people’s co-operative agency based in London. We are passionate about supporting our peers, to set up worker's co-operatives as a collaborative and empowering solution to fix our broken economy. Our aim is to re-imagine the future of work by creating a more equal, democratic, and sustainable economy today. 
          <br><br>
          We are constantly experimenting with the co-operative model and principles, adapting this tried-and-tested form of collective organisation for the 21st century. We are always  iterating and improving the way we collaborate, organise and communicate
          <br><br>
          There are no bosses at Altgen. We’re all paid the same and we make decisions collectively.

            Partnered with co-operatives UK to set up the Young Co-operators Prize, 
            which supported 6 groups of young people to start co-operatives: 
            London-based freelance web developers Founders and Coders; 
            Chapel Street Studio Co-operative, a communications service business from Bradford; 
            digital news platform London Student; 
            Plymouth-based co-working space provider, 
            Dialogue; and Ceramics Studio from London. 
            Each of them received £2,000 to develop innovative new co-op enterprises, 
            as well as an education programme, mentoring, and support.

            This resulted in partnerships with 10 universities across the UK.

          The Freelancers’ Co-operative Pilot is a programme supporting young people in precarious self-employment to develop new forms of mutual support. 
          The programme draws on co-operative and trade union methods and principles to build a culture of solidarity amongst freelancers,

          From January 2017, Altgen - supported by SolidFund and Co-operatives UK -

        <br>
        <p>
          Altgen Transition Space is a partnership between Altgen workers co-operative and universities to support
          recent graduates to kick-start their careers and build a more co-operative economy.
          <br><br>
          The Altgen Transition Space programme is an incubator, 
          equipping recent graduates with the skills to make their ideas a reality by setting up co-operative enterprises. 
          The programme is a journey from education to work, 
          supporting young people to practically challenge the failings of the current economic model. 
          It lasts six months, running twice a year for cohorts of 15 recent graduates 
          (those who have recently finished undergraduate or postgraduate courses). 
          The programme is built around co-operative values and principles, 
          providing a supportive and collaborative environment for graduates to flourish in the world of work 
          - and to transform it.

        <br>
        <p>
          In the co-operative model, we discovered a practical, 
          tangible alternative that is helping people to sustain themselves in a fairer and more meaningful way all over the world. 
          And it’s been around for over 100 years. 
          As the next generation, we want to use and adapt this model as a tool to take control over the things that matter in our lives: 
          from housing to food, from work to community spaces.

          For us, 
          co-operatives are a practical way to tackle the urgent social, 
          economic and environmental problems that our generation faces. 
          Through them we want to transform the daily reality of work for young people and to help build a more 
          <span class='fw500'>equal</span>, 
          <span class='fw500'>democratic</span> and

        <h2 class='fw500 bigger'>What are co-operatives</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Co-operatives are a practical alternative for individual enterprises as well as the economy at large. 
          They are a way of owning and running organisations equally and democratically 
          - whether it’s a business, housing, or a community space. 
          They are owned and run by people like you, 
          not driven by the iron law of maximising shareholder value - and that’s because there are no external shareholders! 
          Whether co-operatives benefit their workers, customers or the community they operate within, 
          they always give their members an equal say over what the enterprise does and an equal share of the proceeds.

        <h2 class='fw500 bigger'>Manifesto</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          We believe in an economy that is equal, democratic
          and sustainable. We are working towards
          a world owned in common, moving beyond an
          economy based on private ownership and accumulation
          of wealth. Our generation is inheriting
          gross inequalities, environmental destruction,
          poverty and political institutions that no longer
          serve us.
        <br><br>
          We believe the co-operative movement can
          transform society. It can create meaningful and
          rewarding work, empower the disempowered
          and serve the collective wellbeing of people
          and our planet.
        <br><br>
          As the next generation we will use the co-operative
          model as a tool to take control over
          things that matter in our lives: from housing to
          food, work to community spaces. To bring back
          ownership and say in spaces that it has been
          lost.
        <br><br>
          The YECN will achieve this vision through sharing
          ideas, best practice and educational resources,
          building relationships and creating
          spaces for exchange both physically and online
          and finally by innovating the co-operative model-
          both by bringing new ideas into the movement
          and by ensuring it truly acts its values of
          democracy, equality, and social and environmental
          responsibility.
