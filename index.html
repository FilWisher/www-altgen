          AltGen was set up by two young graduates after personal experiences of unemployment, unpaid internships and precarious freelance work. We realized we needed to stop competing and start co-operating. We realized that there were many others just like us, and that it was not our fault and the problem was the economy that we have inherited.
          <br><br>
          In the co-operative model, we discovered a practical, tangible alternative that is helping people like us to sustain themselves in a fairer and more meaningful way all over the world. And it's been around for over 100 years. As the next generation, we will use this model as a tool to take control over the things that matter in our lives: from housing to food, from work to community spaces.
          <br><br>
          For us, co-operatives are a practical way to tackle the urgent social and environmental problems that our generation faces: inequality, disempowerment and isolation. We want to transform the daily reality for young people and te help build a more equal, democratic and sustainable economy.

          <p>
          The AltGen approach:
          <br><br> 
          We run educational programmes, campaigns, and workshops to enable young people to set up workers' co-operatives. In all of our work, we use design thinking, graphics, participatory situations, and digital technologies to inspire those we work with. We see ourselves as a bridge, bringing young people into the co-operative movement and bringing the co-operative movement to young people.

          In our first year we:
          <br><br> 
          - Partnered with co-operatives UK to set up the Young Co-operators Prize, which supported 6 groups of young people to start co-operatives: London-based freelance web developers Founders and Coders; Chapel Street Studio Co-operative, a communications service business from Bradford; digital news platform London Student; Plymouth-based co-working space provider, Dialogue; and Ceramics Studio from London. Each of them received £2,000 to develop innovative new co-op enterprises, as well as an education programme, mentoring, and support.
          <br><br>
          - Ran workshops and stalls at universities and careers fairs across the country, speaking to thousssands of students about co-operatives as an alternative to teh status quo of graduate employment. This resulted in partnerships with 10 universities across the UK.
          <br><br>
          - Co-founded the Young European Co-operators Network. This is a new network of over 80 young co-operators from 14 countries across Europe working towards a world owned democratically in common.
          <br><br>
          - Featured in The Guardian, Open Democracy, Positive News, Channel 4 News, and others

          Freelancers' Co-operative Pilot
          <br><br>
          The Freelancers' Co-operative Pilot is a programme supporting young people in precarious self-employment to develop new forms of mutual support. The programme draws on co-operative and trade union methods and principles to build a culture of solidarity amongst freelancers, develop shared back-office support, and amplify the political voice of the self-employed.
          <br><br>
          From December 2016, AltGen - supported by Co-operatives UK - will be running a pilot freelancers' co-operative with a group of 40 freelancers working in London's creative industries.
          <br><br>
          If you are interested in supporting the Freelancers' Co-operative Pilot, please get in touch.

          Transition Space Programme
          <br><br>
          AltGen Transition Spcae is a partnership between Altgen workers co-operative and universities to support recent graduates to kick-start their careers and build a more co-operative economy.
          <br><br>
          The Altgen Transition Space programme is an incubator, equipping recent graduates with the skills to make their ideas a reality by setting up co-operative enterprises. The programme is a joirney from education to work, supporting young people to practically challenge the failings of the current economic model. It lasts six months, running twice a year for cohorts of 15 recent graduates (those who have recently finished undergraduate or postgraduate courses). The programme is built around co-operative values and principles, providing a supportive and collaborative environment for graduates to flourish in the world of work - and to transform it.

        Why co-operatives?
        <br><br>
        Co-operatives are a practical alternative for individual enterprises as well as the economy at large. They are owned and run by people like you, not driven by the iron law of maximising shareholder value - and that’s because there are no external shareholders! Whether co-operatives benefit their workers, customers or the community they operate within, they always give their members an equal say over what the enterprise does, as well as an equal share of the profits. 
        </p>

      <div class="left w40 mb5 m-auto yellow-bg p25 content">
        <p>What are cooperatives?
        <br><br>
        Co-operatives are a specific form of social enterprise where the workers own the business, profit is a distributed fairly and decisions are made democratically. Where you can work with your friends, doing something you love, something that has a positive impact on the world.

        You are 18-35...
        <br><br>
        Your problem? No it's not you
        <br>
        It's the economy.
        <br><br>
        Youth unemployment, unpaid internships, volunteer placements, working for free.
        <br><br>
        9-5 job, work that does not fulfill you, climb the career ladder and we'll make something of you.
        <br><br>
        Unemployed, underemployed, isolated and devalued.
        <br><br>
        We're tired of it, and we're sure you are too. Well guess what? The problem is not you.
        <br><br>
        The problem does not lie with us, it is the product of an economy that was not our creation. It's an economy that forces us to work for free, to enrich the rich, to fight against our friends and sell our souls to corporate companies that destroy our planet and our future.
        <br><br>
        You are not alone!        
        <br><br>
        At Altgen we believe that work should allow us to do better things.
        <br><br>
        Stop competing and start

        COLLABORATING
        <br><br>
        As long as we fight for unpaid work we remain powerless.
        <br><br>
        But when we put our minds and skills together anything is possible.
        <br><br>
        If we collaborate and co-operate we can create a different future - one where we are in control of our work and our economy.

      We believe in making our economy more equal, democratic, and sustainable. Our generation has inherited gross inequalities, environmental destruction, and political institutions that no longer serve us. We are committed to changing this, working towards a world owned in common, moving beyond an economy based on private ownership and accumulation of wealth.
      <br><br>
      We believe that co-operative enterprises are one concrete way of creating this change. They can make work secure and meaningful, empower the disempowered, and serve the collective wellbeing of people and our planet. 
      <br><br>
      As the next generation we will use the co-operative model as a tool to take control over the things that matter in our lives: from housing to food, from work to community spaces. To give people a democratic say and ownership where previously they had none.

          Constance believes in safety, and that's why she never takes her cycle helmet off. It's also why she believes in co-ops as a more robust and solidary form of organisation. She is an enigma - a winner who is terrified of competition. As our Art Director she is responsible for all our learning and design materials, and for drawing all over the toilet walls. Yes Constance, we know it's you.
