        <h3>MANIFESTO /</h3> 
        <p>
        <br>
        We believe in an economy that is equal, democratic and sustainable. We are working towards a world owned in common, moving beyond an economy based on private ownership and accumulation of wealth. Our generation is inheriting gross inequalities, environmental destruction, poverty and political institutions that no longer serve us. 
        <br><br> 
        We believe the co-operative movement can transform society. It can create meaningful and rewarding work, empower the disempowered and serve the collective wellbeing of people and our planet. 
        <br><br> 
        As the next generation we will use the co-operative model as a tool to take control over things that matter in our lives: from housing to food, work to community spaces. To bring back ownership and say in spaces that it has been lost. 
        <br><br> 
        The YECN will achieve this vision through sharing ideas, best practice and educational resources, building relationships and creating spaces for exchange both physically and online and finally by innovating the co-operative model- both by bringing new ideas into the movement and by ensuring it truly acts its values of democracy, equality, and social and environmental responsibility.

          AltGen was set up by two young graduates after personal experiences of unemployment, unpaid internships and precarious freelance work. We realised that we needed to stop compete and start cooperate. That we were not alone but thousands of us were in the same situation and that there was a generational problem, that it was not us but the current economy.
          <br><br>
          We discovered that the cooperative model was a practical alternative that was already transforming economies and lives all over the world.
          <br><br>
          We decided to organise in a workers co-operative and its aim is to re-imagine the future of work and to help our generation to create a more equal, democratic and sustainable economy. We do this in the most tangible, practical way we know: building and spreading cooperative enterprises.

          Altgen is part of international discussions about the new economy and the commons. Having an international perspective and dialogue is essential to us. For this reason, we co-founded of the European Young Co-operators Network in 2015. This network was set up by young people working in co-operatives across Europe to campaign for a better more cooperative cooperative economy and advocate for much better recognition of the needs of young people both within

          In its first year 
          <br><br> 
          Altgen partnered with Cooperatives UK to set up the Young Co-operators Prize, which supported 5 groups of young people to start cooperatives: London-based freelance web developers Founders and Coders; Chapel Street Studio Co-operative, a communications service business from Bradford; digital news platform London Student; Plymouth-based co-working space provider, Dialogue; and Ceramics Studio from London all received £2,000 to develop innovative new co-op enterprises, plus mentoring and support. They went on to form the Young Cooperators Network with Altgen and Blake House Studio.

          The Young Cooperators Network 
          <br><br>
          The Young Co-operators Network (YCN) is a group of cooperative enterprises that come together to build the cooperative economy. We gather 4 times a year to think big and small: from building ‘the commons’ to how to ensure invoice are paid on time. We also organise educational weekends on various themes. If you are interested in joining the group,

        <p>What are cooperatives?
        <br><br>
        Co-operatives are a practical alternative for individual enterprises as well as the economy at large. They are owned and run by people like you, not driven by the iron law of maximising shareholder value - and that’s because there are no external shareholders! Whether co-operatives benefit their workers, customers or the community they operate within, they always give their members an equal say over what the enterprise does, as well as an equal share of the profits.
