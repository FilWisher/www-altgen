          We are very excited to be running this workshop with the fabulous Jonny from Stir to Action, 
          on the 15/10/16 at the Altgen Space in Borough London. See details below:
        <br><br>
          The contemporary economy is failing young people and many others. 
          One in seven of the UK workforce are now self-employed and this has grown by around 39% since 2000. 
          The nature of work is transforming but the economy is not changing with it - 
          unstable, unequal and unable to produce secure, meaningful work for all.
        <br><br>
          This workshop, part of the Stir to workshop series, will introduce you to co-operative alternatives, 
          best practices and how to work together to overcome individualistic and isolating work cultures and start co-operatives. 
          Practical exercises will help you imagine and articulate how to use your skills, passions, 
          resources and networks to turn your ideas into democratically-run enterprise. 
          Take a first leap into creating a better future for yourself and those around you with the Altgen team!
